# -Spartan6---DSP48A1
🔹 Project 1: Spartan-6 DSP48A1 Design

This project focused on designing a DSP48A1, a fundamental arithmetic block used in FPGA-based DSP and high-performance digital systems (e.g., signal processing).

 • Modeled the internal DSP48A1 architecture in parameterized Verilog RTL, including data paths and pipelining

 • Developed directed, self-checking testbenches to verify multiple operation modes

 • Automated QuestaSim using do files

 • Analyzed linting warnings

 • Completed the full Vivado flow, verified timing at 100 MHz, and achieved clean synthesis and implementation

strengthing the understanding of DSP blocks, pipelining, and verifying testbench techniques.
